# UBCHackathon
Hackathon on Learning Analytics at UBC on 2-3 November 2019

Idea proposal:  SSC portal in general portrays the data about the courses offered by UBC and allows students to check the availability to enroll for one of them. However, students access Canvas on a daily basis as compared to the SSC portal. Our idea is to develop a Tableau dashboard which summarizes the data about the courses offered by UBC and integrate this dashboard in Canvas. Based on the insights given by the dashboard, students can decide which course to take up.
